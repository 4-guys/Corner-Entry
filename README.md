# Corner-Entry

## Quick Summary
* Created a racing auto event website where users can sign up an create an account on the website and sign up for local events happening near them.

## Website Runthrough
1. When the website loads the first page that the user see's is the home, *index.html*, page, where it includes an introductory paragraph and several nav bar's to navigate to different parts of the website.

2. In the top right corner of the website, there is a *LOG IN* button where, if clicked, will take them to the login page of the website.

* Additionally, under the login page form, there is also a link to take them to the sign up page if the user doesn't have a registered account on our website. If they choose this option, the page will load a sign up form and the user just has to input their information that the website is requesting and hit *Sumbit* when completed.

3. If the login is successful, the website will load the members page, in which loads all the premade events that the user can sign up for.

4. Once they have chosen which event they wanted to sign up for, the page will load that they have successfully registered for the event and then takes them to the event home page shortly after.
